    <p>Welcome to <strong>Baseline CompaRe</strong>. This tool is designed to help with the
    analysis of E8.5-10.5 trancriptomics data, particularly in cases where
    the embryos of interest are developmentally delayed.
    We have produced RNA-seq data for wild-type embryos for stages from
    4 to 36 somites to form a baseline for comparison to experimental samples.
    This allows us to prioritise genes that are more likely to be differentially
    expressed due to the condition of interest, rather than due to developmental delay.</p>
    <p>To get started you need pre-computed count data from your RNA-seq data.</p>
